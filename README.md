# get_next_line

This is a 42 project. The purpose is to implement the function 
get_next_line which returns one line at a time from a text file. 
In this project you'll understand how opened, read and closed in an OS,
and how they are interpreted by a programming language for further analysis.

But first, how can I <b>install</b> and <b>run</b> this project? 

### 1 - First things first, you need to include the header:  

    #include "get_next_line.h"
  
### 2 - To compile, use the source files and the required flag:

    cc get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c -D BUFFER_SIZE=<size>
    
### Tip! You can use scrpits such as:

and that's basically it! :)
