This is a 42 project. The purpose is to implement the function 
get_next_line which returns one line at a time from a text file. 
In this project you'll understand how files are opened, read and closed in an OS,
and how they are interpreted by a programming language for further analysis.

But how can I <b>run</b> this project? 

### 1 - First things first, you need to include the header:  
```C
#include "get_next_line.h"
```
### Or, in case of bonus, you need to include the header of bonus:
```C
#include "get_next_line_bonus.h"
```
### 2 - To compile, use the source files and the required flag:

    cc get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c -D BUFFER_SIZE=<size>
    
### Tip! You can use scripts such as:

   <a href="https://github.com/Tripouille/gnlTester" target="_blank">Tripouille/gnlTester</a>
        
and that's basically it! :)
